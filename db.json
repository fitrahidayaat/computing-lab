In this paper, we implement reversible data hiding (RDH) on medical image because the correlation between the neighboring pixel can be preserved in encrypted image. In RDH, plain image is encrypted using specific encryption algorithm that consists of two processes (stream encryption algorithm and block permutation). However, since RDH used fixed block permutation, the security is weak against known plain text attack. To overcome this problem, dynamic permutation was proposed, such that the permutation would be specific for one session. In other session, different permutation would be used.
